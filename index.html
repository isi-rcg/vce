      A cloud framework to emulate line-of-sight, latency, and
      bandwidth of satellite applications in AWS virtual
      machines. Performance metrics (CPU, memory, disk, network) are
      collected from the constellation and recorded in a time series
      database to analyze performance bottlenecks.

    <h2>Motivation</h2>
    <p>
      The goal of VCE is to assist in prototyping, development and
      evaluation of distributed applications running on satellite
      constellations, airborne systems, and ground stations.
    </p>
    <p>
      Example applications include Earth imaging, marine biology, and
      ecology studies based on spectral reflectance instruments and
      infrared imagers and sounders.
    </p>
    <p>
      These missions require autonomous coordination across multiple
      platforms to capture dynamic events, to combine measurements
      from different instruments, to transmit preliminary results with
      low latency, and to perform intelligent instrument utilization
      for increased lifespan.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="col-lg-4">
    <h2>Approach</h2>
    <p>
      Each base station or satellite in the constellation runs as a
      separate AWS virtual machine.
    </p>
    <p>
      At startup, a VCE agent is installed to control network
      parameters such as link state (up/down), latency and bandwidth:
      a VCE server (running on a separate VM) provides these
      parameters to the VCE agents based on the simulated position of
      each satellite.
    </p>
    <p>
      In addition, the user can schedule network faults or
      distruptions, to test the performance of the distributed
      application under failure.
    </p>
    <p>
      Metrics such as CPU, memory, disk and network usage are
      collected from each virtual machine over time, and stored in a
      time series database for real-time or offline analysis.
